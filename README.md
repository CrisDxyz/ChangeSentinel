# ChangeSentinel

Automatically create local backups of your files as soon as they are modified.
Add the paths to the files you want to monitor, and the paths to save the file backups.

You can monitor from complete projects to that single script that needs a complete refactor but you are afraid to break it with a single change.

Personally don't really like github or other cloud systems, so I made this tool.

*I will upload a fancy version written in AHK v2 after I make it prettier and more friendly to non programmers.

# Why use it?

You don't need or want to rely on cloud services, or you don't like the idea of your code/repo/project being scraped to train AI.
This tool aims to just keeping it simple, creating a backup each time you save changes on the file(s), similar to windows backups.

# GUI Overview

The Script stays in the corner of your screen and shows the last file that got backed up.
